I'm a first-year doctoral candidate from [College of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://eng.nju.edu.cn/), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/). My research interest includes nonlinear optics, non-reciprocal optics, doped fiber, and Quantum optics. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Keyu Xia](https://eng.nju.edu.cn/45/3a/c5183a476474/page.htm) of [CWQED Lab](https://cwqed.nju.edu.cn/) from College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Nanjing University.
