Nonlinear non-reciprocal optical devices, allowing transmission of light with different efficiencies in opposite directions without using a magnetic field, are key elements for modern optical communication and integrated photonics circuits. They exploit high-quality resonators or wave mixing pumped by a strong classical field to circumvent the weak material nonlinearity, but their applications are therefore constrained by narrow non-reciprocal bandwidth. Here, by combining the gain-saturation nonlinearity of an erbium-doped optical fiber and the asymmetric inputs, we experimentally demonstrate a broadband all-fiber non-reciprocal optical device. This non-magnetic device operating at telecom wavelength shows non-reciprocal transmission with contrast of 19.97 dB over a bandwidth of 33.3 nm, and reaches a maximum contrast of 23.91 dB.
